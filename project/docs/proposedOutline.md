# Zephyra Advanced Architecture Design

## 1. Foundation: Transformer-based Architecture

- Use a decoder-only transformer architecture similar to GPT models
- Implement rotary positional embeddings (RoPE) for better handling of position information
- Utilize flash attention for more efficient attention computation

## 2. Advanced Attention Mechanisms

- Implement multi-query attention for improved efficiency
- Add sliding window attention to handle longer sequences
- Incorporate key-value caching for faster inference

## 3. Activation Functions and Normalization

- Use SwiGLU activation function in feed-forward layers for better performance
- Implement RMSNorm (Root Mean Square Layer Normalization) instead of traditional LayerNorm

## 4. Tokenization and Embedding

- Implement Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization
- Use tied input and output embeddings

## 5. Model Parallelism and Efficiency

- Design for tensor parallelism to allow distributed training across multiple GPUs
- Implement gradient checkpointing for memory efficiency during training

## 6. Adapter Integration

- Design the architecture to easily accommodate LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) or AdapterFusion
- Include adapter injection points in attention and feed-forward layers

## 7. Routing Mechanism (tiny ada)

- Implement a lightweight transformer-based classifier for domain routing
- Design an efficient method to switch between or combine multiple adapters based on the routing output

## 8. Advanced Training Techniques

- Implement a mixed-precision training pipeline
- Add support for gradient accumulation to handle larger batch sizes

## 9. Inference Optimizations

- Design for quantization-aware training to support post-training quantization
- Implement an efficient token generation strategy (e.g., speculative decoding)

## 10. Modular Design

- Create a modular architecture that allows easy swapping of components (e.g., attention mechanisms, normalization layers)
- Design a configuration system to easily adjust model size and hyperparameters
