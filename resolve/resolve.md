# Zephyra Model Architecture: Poly-Domain-Unified-Architecture

## 1. Overview

Zephyra implements a novel Poly-Domain-Unified-Architecture, which combines a large language model (LLM) base with multiple domain-specific adapters and a routing mechanism. This architecture aims to achieve efficient multi-domain adaptation while maintaining a single unified model.

## 2. Core Components

### 2.1 Base Language Model

- <b>Architecture</b>: Transformer-based built by me called 'Zephyra fusion'
- <b>Size</b>: Under research
- <b>Layers</b>: Under research
- <b>Attention Heads</b>: Under research
- <b>Hidden Size</b>: Under research

The base model serves as the foundation, capturing general language understanding and generation capabilities.

### 2.2 Domain-Specific Adapters

- Type: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
- Number of Adapters: Under research
- Rank: Under research
- Targeted Layers: Attention and Feed-Forward layers in transformer blocks

Each adapter specializes in a specific domain, allowing for efficient fine-tuning without modifying the entire base model.

### 2.3 Routing Mechanism ("tiny ada")

- Architecture: Lightweight transformer or feed-forward network
- Input: User prompt or context
- Output: Probability distribution over available domains
- Size: Significantly smaller than the base model (e.g., 1-5% of base model size)

The routing mechanism determines which domain-specific adapter(s) should be activated for a given input.

## 3. Detailed Architecture

### 3.1 Base Model Layer

```
Input Embedding
│
├─ Transformer Block 1
│   ├─ Self-Attention
│   │   ├─ Query Projection (+ LoRA)
│   │   ├─ Key Projection (+ LoRA)
│   │   ├─ Value Projection (+ LoRA)
│   │   └─ Output Projection (+ LoRA)
│   │
│   └─ Feed-Forward Network
│       ├─ FF Layer 1 (+ LoRA)
│       └─ FF Layer 2 (+ LoRA)
│
├─ Transformer Block 2
│   [Similar structure to Block 1]
│
...
│
├─ Transformer Block N
│   [Similar structure to Block 1]
│
Output Layer
```

### 3.2 LoRA Adapter Integration

Each LoRA adapter consists of two low-rank matrices (A and B) for each adapted layer:

```
Original Weight Matrix (W)
│
├─ LoRA Matrix A [r x d_in]
│   └─ LoRA Matrix B [d_out x r]
│       └─ Scaling Factor (α)
│
Modified Weight: W + α(BA)
```

Where:
- r: rank of the LoRA decomposition
- d_in: input dimension of the layer
- d_out: output dimension of the layer
- α: scaling factor

### 3.3 Routing Mechanism

```

```

## 4. Forward Pass

1. Input Processing:
   - Tokenize and embed the input text
   - Pass the embedded input through the routing mechanism

2. Adapter Selection:
   - Based on the routing output, select the appropriate domain adapter(s)
   - In case of multi-domain queries, a weighted combination of adapters may be used

3. Base Model Computation:
   - For each transformer block:
     - Apply self-attention with LoRA adjustments
     - Apply feed-forward layers with LoRA adjustments

4. Output Generation:
   - Final layer computation (e.g., language modeling head)
   - Generate output based on the task (e.g., next token prediction, classification)

## 5. Training Process

1. Pre-train the base model on a large corpus (if not using an existing pre-trained model)
2. Train domain-specific LoRA adapters while freezing the base model
3. Train the routing mechanism using a dataset covering all domains
4. Fine-tune the entire system end-to-end with a small learning rate

## 6. Inference Optimizations

- Caching: Implement key-value caching for efficient autoregressive generation
- Quantization: Apply post-training quantization to reduce model size and increase inference speed
- Batching: Optimize for batched inference to improve throughput

## 7. Scalability Considerations

- New Domain Addition: Design the system to easily incorporate new domain adapters without retraining the entire model
- Adapter Pruning: Implement mechanisms to remove or combine less useful adapters
- Distributed Inference: Plan for distributing adapter computations across multiple devices for very large numbers of domains

## 8. Monitoring and Evaluation

- Per-domain Performance Metrics: Track performance for each domain separately
- Routing Accuracy: Monitor the accuracy of the domain routing mechanism
- Inference Latency: Measure and optimize the additional latency introduced by the routing mechanism

This architecture combines the flexibility of domain-specific adaptation with the efficiency of a unified base model, allowing Zephyra to handle diverse domains while maintaining computational efficiency.
